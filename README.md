# Rating Predictor for Video Games

The "Rating Predictor for Video Games" project is a comprehensive exploration of machine learning techniques to predict the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) ratings for video games based on a variety of features. This project is designed to analyze and leverage a vast dataset, using advanced algorithms to predict the appropriate ESRB rating for video games, which is crucial for both gamers and the gaming industry.

With the ever-growing number of video games released each year, having an automated system that predicts ESRB ratings can significantly streamline the rating process, providing timely and consistent ratings for games based on their content. This can improve consumer trust, assist game developers in understanding the potential audience for their games, and ensure appropriate gaming experiences for players of different age groups.

Through this project, we hope to contribute to the gaming industry by providing an efficient and reliable method for predicting ESRB ratings, fostering better gaming experiences, and facilitating informed decisions for both players and game developers.

2. `test_esrb.csv`: A separate test dataset for evaluating the model's performance.

## Project Workflow

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The raw data is loaded and cleaned using pandas.
2. Feature Selection: Relevant features are chosen to build the model.
3. Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
4. Feature Scaling: StandardScaler is used to scale the features.
5. Model Selection: A variety of classifiers are trained and tested on the training dataset.
6. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics.

## Additional Information

- The dataset provided contains information on various features that may impact the ESRB rating, such as game content, genre, platform, etc.
- The project also aims to handle missing data and outliers appropriately during the preprocessing phase.
- Feature engineering techniques may be employed to extract relevant information from the given features.
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation can be further explored to optimize model performance.
